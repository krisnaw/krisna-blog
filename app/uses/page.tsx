      Whenever I tweet a picture of my setup or my dog (with my desk in the background) I get asked plenty of questions about my display, keyboard, microphone, ReMarkable… you name it. That’s why I created this short list for everyone interested in the tools I use.

      Software

      I use PhpStorm as my main IDE, but occasionally open VS Code to peek into a file.

      Tinkerwell runs all day, as does Herd, as it powers my web environment with various PHP versions (and I work on it too).

      I breathe the air of the iTerm2 terminal with oh-my-zsh installed. CleanShot is unmatched for screenshots, just like Tuple is for pairing sessions and Raycast is a Spotlight-replacement on steroids.

      I'm writing these lines in my favorite markdown editor Obsidian, but use Notion for complex notes. Obsidian also holds my work to-do lists.

      For messaging, I use Slack, Telegram, and Spark.

      In daily life, I use a good ol' notebook with the Bullet Journal method.

      Hardware

      My workspace is organized around a Fully Jarvis standing desk, and to get that movement in, I also have a desk treadmill.

      The machine of my choice is a MacBook Pro 16" (2021, M1 Pro, 16GB RAM), which is wonderful.

      For peripherals, I use a nuPhy Air 75, a Logitech MX Master 3, and an LG Ergo 32" monitor.

      My webcam setup consists of a Canon M50 with a 22mm/f2 lens, mounted to an Elgato Master Mount.
