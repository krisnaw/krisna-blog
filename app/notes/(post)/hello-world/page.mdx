Dashboards let you combine data from different Linear sources into a single view, whether that’s monitoring operational
health, keeping tabs on team workflows, or reporting on how resources are being spent across initiatives.

Teams have created thousands of dashboards since we launched them in July, with especially strong
uptake among enterprise customers: more than half of enterprise workspaces now use at least one.


## Practice 1: Fewer dashboards is generally better

We’ve observed that the median workspace creates just two dashboards, and adoption drops off quickly beyond that. When every team spins up dozens, most go stale and stop being trusted. The solution is to make each dashboard intentional, with a clear purpose and an owner. Build regular review cycles into your process so dashboards stay accurate and relevant.
