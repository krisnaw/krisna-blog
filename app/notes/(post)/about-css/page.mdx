# About CSS Properties


### white-space:

White-space is a property that lets us tweak how words and other inline/inline-block elements wrap.
By setting it to nowrap, we instruct the container to never break lines.
That, in tandem with overflow: auto, allows us to achieve a horizontally-scrollable element.
