# Timing Function

`animation-timing-function` is CSS property that sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.
So when applying animation, instead of flipping from one from to another, we *interpolate* between values over given timeframes.

`transition: transform 550ms;`

For example, this code will tell us whenever the transform property changes, it should take 550 milliseconds to move from the
original values to the new values.

## linear

__linear__ timing function usually used for circular animation like spinner.

## ease-in

__ease-in__ timing function starts slowly and picks up the speed, stopping suddenly at the end of the duration.
This timing function is usually used for things that exiting view

## ease-out

__ease-out__ is opposite of what __ease-in__ does so can be used for entering the view.


## ease-in-out

__ease-in-out__ is the combination of __ease-in__ and __ease-out__, it features the same amount of acceleration at the start and
deceleration at the end. This symmetrical is useful when you want to animate something moving back and forth.

## ease

**__ease__** is the **default timing function** when we don't **specify** one when creating **an** animation.

This timing function is **similar to** **__ease-in-out__** but is not **symmetrical**, meaning it **quickly accelerates** in the **beginning** but spends most of the time **slowing** down, and easing to a stop.

**Compared** to other **timing functions**, **__ease__** has a more **broad** use case, so it makes sense as **the** default value.
