# Typography

Welcome to the typography showcase. This note demonstrates how headings, paragraphs, emphasis, and other inline styles render inside the blog.

## Displaying Hierarchy

### Section Headline

Use clear headings to break up long-form content and guide the reader.

#### Subsection Callout

Even smaller headings keep ideas organized without overwhelming the page.

##### Detail Title

###### Micro Heading

Paragraph text should stay conversational while introducing key ideas. Use short sentences and occasional longer ones so the cadence feels natural.

## Inline Styling

Emphasis helps highlight `inline code`, *italic text*, **bold statements**, and ~~corrections~~ when needed.

## Lists for Structure

1. Start with a leading idea.
2. Add clarifying points.
3. Close with a takeaway.

- Bullets keep thoughts lightweight.
- They work well for quick summaries.
- Finish with a concise conclusion.

## Quotations

> Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form.
>
> â€” Robert Bringhurst

## Dividers

Use horizontal rules to create clean breaks between major sections.

That concludes the typography tour. Keep headings intentional, paragraphs focused, and inline styling purposeful for the best reading experience.
