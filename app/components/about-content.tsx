           I`m a design engineer & designer at OpenSea. I design and build products that feel magical, yet simple and intuitive.
           I obsess over the smallest details and I like to make people feel something through my work.

        From there, I dove into learning about coding and the web. Discovering
        HTML and CSS opened up a whole new world for me — I began creating my
        own projects, figuring out how to make the UI match what I envisioned,
        and exploring new approaches to bring ideas to life. It was exciting and
        challenging, and I've been hooked ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        For over seven years, I've been translating designs into functional,
        usable UIs. I enjoy the process of turning a concept into something
        people can interact with, especially when I can make it efficient and
        accessible. My main stack includes React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and
        Next.js, which I use to bring projects to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tackling complex challenges is something I genuinely enjoy; the tougher
        the problem, the more driven I am to find a solution. I often dive deep
        into projects and put in extra time to get things right. I also value
        working with others — collaboration helps me understand problems better
        and gives me a chance to learn from each person's unique experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm always exploring new interests and focusing on
        self-improvement. I enjoy running, boxing, reading, and learning
        languages, and I attend meetups mainly to connect and communicate with
        others.
